Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.
Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:



A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)


eg. On xs and sm screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On m and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid


Responsive images


BONUS
   Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)


Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
