      <p>Fare you well, my only true one. Call for his whiskey, he can call for his tea,. Unto a foolish heart. Sleepy Alligator in the noon day sun,. Goes to show you don't ever know. Carve your name. Costs a lot to win, and even more to lose.</p>

      <p>Don't you let that deal go down, no, no. Search for where the rivers end. Crown yourself the king of clowns. Lulu, my Lulu, come and open the door. Carve your name in ice and wind.</p> 

      <p>Wait until that deal come round. Make myself a bed by the waterside. Call all he want to, but he can't call for me.</p>
